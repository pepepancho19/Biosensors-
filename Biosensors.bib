abstract = {PVA capped spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized at various pH conditions of reaction solution by chemical reduction method. Tuning of reaction solution pH in a narrow range could have a profound effect on particle size. The synthesized AgNPs have been characterized by studying their structural, morphological, optical and antimicrobial properties. Crystallite size decrement with the increase of pH was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. UV-vis spectra showed single surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at $\sim$. 420. nm and a blue shift in SPR was elicited with increment of pH. AgNPs were found to be photoluminescent and enhancement in photoluminescence intensity was observed with the increase in the reaction solution of pH. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements indicated that the nanoparticles were capped by PVA. The synthesized AgNPs displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Aspergillus niger and Penicillium sp. with particle size decrement.},

The AgNPs synthesized by this method exhibited size distribution from 5 to 249 nm, depending on pH, as determined by dynamic light scattering, and morphology spherical, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. In pH range 3–7 occurred aggregation of the nanoparticles. The size distribution depending on pH was determined by dynamic light scattering. The zeta potential was determined, and the colloidal stability was correlated with nanoparticles aggregation at different pHs. The size-dependent antimicrobial activity was evaluated for two solutions, wherein both samples exhibited antimicrobial activity, although the smallest AgNPs without agglomeration have enhanced antimicrobial properties.},

abstract = {Background: Type I collagen is an abundant natural polymer with several applications in medicine as matrix to regenerate tissues. Silver nanoparticles is an important nanotechnology material with many utilities in some areas such as medicine, biology and chemistry. The present study focused on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) stabilized with type I collagen (AgNPcol) to build a nanomaterial with biological utility. Three formulations of AgNPcol were physicochemical characterized, antibacterial activity in vitro and cell viability assays were analyzed. AgNPcol was characterized by means of the following: ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic absorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy and of X-ray diffraction analysis. Results: All AgNPcol showed spherical and positive zeta potential. The AgNPcol at a molar ratio of 1:6 showed better characteristics, smaller hydrodynamic diameter (64.34 ± 16.05) and polydispersity index (0.40 ± 0.05), and higher absorbance and silver reduction efficiency (0.645 mM), when compared with the particles prepared in other mixing ratios. Furthermore, these particles showed antimicrobial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and no toxicity to the cells at the examined concentrations. Conclusions: The resulted particles exhibited favorable characteristics, including the spherical shape, diameter between 64.34 nm and 81.76 nm, positive zeta potential, antibacterial activity, and non-toxicity to the tested cells (OSCC).},

AgNPs play an important role in nanoscience and nanotechnology, particularly in nanomedicine. Although several noble metals have been used for various purposes, AgNPs have been focused on potential applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this review, we discuss the synthesis of AgNPs using physical, chemical, and biological methods. We also discuss the properties of AgNPs and methods for their characterization. More importantly, we extensively discuss the multifunctional bio-applications of AgNPs; for example, as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-cancer agents, and the mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of AgNPs. In addition, we discuss therapeutic approaches and challenges for cancer therapy using AgNPs. Finally, we conclude by discussing the future perspective of AgNPs.},

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a typical plant polyphenol, was grafted onto the CF surface to serve as a reducing-cum-stabilizing agent, so that the AgNPs were generated on the CF surface without extra chemical reductant or physical treatments. The formation of AgNPs was verified by UV-vis DRS, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, TEM, EDX, and HRTEM measurements. Dispersed AgNPs with small particle size were successfully produced, and the mean particle size of AgNPs could be effectively controlled in the range 22–5 nm simply by varying the grafting degree of EGCG on the CF surface. As-prepared Ag–EGCG–CF materials were subjected to antibacterial assay using Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli), as a bacterium model. It was found that Ag–EGCG–CF exhibited excellent antibacterial activity and good durable biocidal utility for repeated use, which was highly dependent on the particle size of AgNPs and the grafting degree of EGCG.},

Recently, the use of collagen as an effective nanoparticle stabilization agent was reported. In this work, synthesis of silver nanoparticles using mixed capping agents is reported. The capping agents used were cashew gum-hydrolyzed collagen; kappa carrageenan-hydrolyzed collagen, and agar-hydrolyzed collagen. We evaluated antibacterial action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as antifungal activity and cytotoxicity. Homogenized mixtures of collagen and aqueous cashew gum, carrageenan or agar respectively were used to produce the nanoparticles AgNPcolCashew, AgNPcolCarr and AgNPcolAgar. AgNP characterization was performed using Uv-vis, XRD, TEM and DLS and the biological activities were assayed using MIC and MBC analyses for both antibacterial and antifungal application. Results showed that the AgNPcollcar sample showed the strongest bacterial inhibition with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.25 $\mu$M/mL Ag against E. coli and P. aeruginosa respectively. Interestingly, AgNPcollAgar also presented the lowest cytotoxicity when compared with other AgNPs and AgNO3.},

abstract = {Due to their unique antimicrobial properties silver nanocrystallites have garnered substantial attention and are used extensively for biomedical applications as an additive to wound dressings, surgical instruments and bone substitute materials. They are also released into unintended locations such as the environment or biosphere. Therefore it is imperative to understand the potential interactions, fate and transport of nanoparticles with environmental biotic systems. Numerous factors including the composition, size, shape, surface charge, and capping molecule of nanoparticles are known to influence cell cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that the physical/chemical properties of the silver nanoparticles including surface charge, differential binding and aggregation potential, which are influenced by the surface coatings, are a major determining factor in eliciting cytotoxicity and in dictating potential cellular interactions. In the present investigation, silver nanocrystallites with nearly uniform size and shape distribution but with different surface coatings, imparting overall high negativity to high positivity, were synthesized. These nanoparticles included poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride-Ag, biogenic-Ag, colloidal-Ag (uncoated), and oleate-Ag with zeta potentials +45 {\^{A}}± 5, -12 {\^{A}}± 2, -42 {\^{A}}± 5, and -45 {\^{A}}± 5 mV, respectively; the particles were purified and thoroughly characterized so as to avoid false cytotoxicity interpretations. A systematic investigation on the cytotoxic effects, cellular response, and membrane damage caused by these four different silver nanoparticles was carried out using multiple toxicity measurements on mouse macrophage (RAW-264.7) and lung epithelial (C-10) cell lines. Our results clearly indicate that the cytotoxicity was dependent on various factors such as surface charge and coating materials used in the synthesis, particle aggregation, and the cell-type for the different silver nanoparticles that were investigated. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-coated Ag nanoparticles were found to be the most toxic, followed by biogenic-Ag and oleate-Ag nanoparticles, whereas uncoated or colloidal silver nanoparticles were found to be the least toxic to both macrophage and lung epithelial cells. Also, based on our cytotoxicity interpretations, lung epithelial cells were found to be more resistant to the silver nanoparticles than the macrophage cells, regardless of the surface coating. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance of the pathogenic microorganisms to the antimicrobial drugs has become a major impediment toward successful diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based medicines have opened new horizons for combating multidrug resistance in microorganisms. In particular, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potent antibacterial agent has received much attention. The most critical physico-chemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of AgNPs include size, shape, surface charge, concentration and colloidal state. AgNPs exhibits their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. AgNPs adhesion to microbial cells, penetration inside the cells, ROS and free radical generation, and modulation of microbial signal transduction pathways have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. On the other side, AgNPs exposure to human cells induces cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response in human cells in a cell-type dependent manner. This has raised concerns regarding use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery. We have summarized the emerging endeavors that address current challenges in relation to safe use of AgNPs in therapeutics and drug delivery platforms. Based on research done so far, we believe that AgNPs can be engineered so as to increase their efficacy, stability, specificity, biosafety and biocompatibility. In this regard, three perspectives research directions have been suggested that include (1) synthesizing AgNPs with controlled physico-chemical properties, (2) examining microbial development of resistance toward AgNPs, and (3) ascertaining the susceptibility of cytoxicity, genotoxicity, and inflammatory response to human cells upon AgNPs exposure.},

Al also displays good thermal and electrical properties, as well as good ductility and corrosion resistance. However, the need for nanomaterials, including Ag, Al and their respective nanoalloys has grown over the past decade or so. The use of nanomaterials lies inherently in their large surface-to-volume ratio which helps improve catalytic and interfacial processes. Their nano sizes also improve hardness, fracture toughness and low-temperature ductility. Nanomaterials also enable lower processing temperatures as compared to bulk materials and faster reaction time due to their higher surface reactivity. Nanomaterials of metal elements are regularly alloyed in order to create nanoalloys with much superior thermal and electrical properties. Many methods have been reported for synthesizing Ag and Al nanoparticles and their respective nanoalloys, including the chemical reduction route.

There is a growing interest in the extraction process of collagen and its derivatives due to the growing tendency to use this protein to replace synthetic agents in various industrial processes, which results in a greater appreciation of the by-products from animal slaughter. Collagen's characteristics depend on the raw material and the extraction conditions, which subsequently determine its application. The most commonly used extraction methods are based on the solubility of collagen in neutral saline solutions, acid solutions, and acid solutions with added enzymes. Recently, the use of ultrasound, combined with these traditional processes, has proven effective in increasing the extraction yield. The objective of this review is to address the different collagen extraction processes, from raw materials to the use of combinations of chemical and enzymatic processes, as well as the use of ultrasound.

abstract = {Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in animals. It is the major component of skin. It finds uses in cosmetics, medicine, yarn production and packaging. This paper reviews the extraction of collagen from hides of most consumed animals for meat with the focus on literature published since 2000. The different pretreatment and extraction techniques that have been investigated for producing collagen from animal skins are reviewed. Pretreatment by enzymatic, acid or alkaline methods have been used. Extraction by chemical hydrolysis, salt solubilization, enzymatic hydrolysis, ultrasound assisted extraction and other methods are described. Post-extraction purification methods are also explained. This compilation will be useful for anyone wishing to use collagen as a resource and wanting to further improve the extraction and purification methods.},

abstract = {Collagen, the most abundant extracellular matrix protein in animal kingdom belongs to a family of fibrous proteins, which transfer load in tissues and which provide a highly biocompatible environment for cells. This high biocompatibility makes collagen a perfect biomaterial for implantable medical products and scaffolds for in vitro testing systems. To manufacture collagen based solutions, porous sponges, membranes and threads for surgical and dental purposes or cell culture matrices, collagen rich tissues as skin and tendon of mammals are intensively processed by physical and chemical means. Other tissues such as pericardium and intestine are more gently decellularized while maintaining their complex collagenous architectures. Tissue processing technologies are organized as a series of steps, which are combined in different ways to manufacture structurally versatile materials with varying properties in strength, stability against temperature and enzymatic degradation and cellular response. Complex structures are achieved by combined technologies. Different drying techniques are performed with sterilisation steps and the preparation of porous structures simultaneously. Chemical crosslinking is combined with casting steps as spinning, moulding or additive manufacturing techniques. Important progress is expected by using collagen based bio-inks, which can be formed into 3D structures and combined with live cells. This review will give an overview of the technological principles of processing collagen rich tissues down to collagen hydrolysates and the methods to rebuild differently shaped products. The effects of the processing steps on the final materials properties are discussed especially with regard to the thermal and the physical properties and the susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. These properties are key features for biological and clinical application, handling and metabolization.},

abstract = {Collagen is the most abundant structural protein found in humans and mammals, particularly in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Its primary function is to hold the body together. The collagen superfamily of proteins includes over 20 types that have been identified. Yet, collagen type I is the major component in many tissues and can be extracted as a natural biomaterial for various medical and biological purposes. Collagen has multiple advantageous characteristics, including varied sources, biocompatibility, sustainability, low immunogenicity, porosity, and biodegradability. As such, collagen-type-I-based bioscaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering. Biomaterials based on collagen type I can also be modified to improve their functions, such as by crosslinking to strengthen the mechanical property or adding biochemical factors to enhance their biological activity. This review discusses the complexities of collagen type I structure, biosynthesis, sources for collagen derivatives, methods of isolation and purification, physicochemical characteristics, and the current development of collagen-type-I-based scaffolds in tissue engineering applications. The advancement of additional novel tissue engineered bioproducts with refined techniques and continuous biomaterial augmentation is facilitated by understanding the conventional design and application of biomaterials based on collagen type I.},

abstract = {Due to their unique antimicrobial properties silver nanocrystallites have garnered substantial attention and are used extensively for biomedical applications as an additive to wound dressings, surgical instruments and bone substitute materials. They are also released into unintended locations such as the environment or biosphere. Therefore it is imperative to understand the potential interactions, fate and transport of nanoparticles with environmental biotic systems. Numerous factors including the composition, size, shape, surface charge, and capping molecule of nanoparticles are known to influence cell cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that the physical/chemical properties of the silver nanoparticles including surface charge, differential binding and aggregation potential, which are influenced by the surface coatings, are a major determining factor in eliciting cytotoxicity and in dictating potential cellular interactions. In the present investigation, silver nanocrystallites with nearly uniform size and shape distribution but with different surface coatings, imparting overall high negativity to high positivity, were synthesized. These nanoparticles included poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride-Ag, biogenic-Ag, colloidal-Ag (uncoated), and oleate-Ag with zeta potentials +45 {\^{A}}± 5, -12 {\^{A}}± 2, -42 {\^{A}}± 5, and -45 {\^{A}}± 5 mV, respectively; the particles were purified and thoroughly characterized so as to avoid false cytotoxicity interpretations. A systematic investigation on the cytotoxic effects, cellular response, and membrane damage caused by these four different silver nanoparticles was carried out using multiple toxicity measurements on mouse macrophage (RAW-264.7) and lung epithelial (C-10) cell lines. Our results clearly indicate that the cytotoxicity was dependent on various factors such as surface charge and coating materials used in the synthesis, particle aggregation, and the cell-type for the different silver nanoparticles that were investigated. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-coated Ag nanoparticles were found to be the most toxic, followed by biogenic-Ag and oleate-Ag nanoparticles, whereas uncoated or colloidal silver nanoparticles were found to be the least toxic to both macrophage and lung epithelial cells. Also, based on our cytotoxicity interpretations, lung epithelial cells were found to be more resistant to the silver nanoparticles than the macrophage cells, regardless of the surface coating. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, the vast potential of nanomaterials for biomedical and healthcare applications has been extensively investigated. Several case studies demonstrated that nanomaterials can offer solutions to the current challenges of raw materials in the biomedical and healthcare fields. This review describes the different nanoparticles and nanostructured material synthesis approaches and presents some emerging biomedical, healthcare, and agro-food applications. This review focuses on various nanomaterial types (e.g., spherical, nanorods, nanotubes, nanosheets, nanofibers, core-shell, and mesoporous) that can be synthesized from different raw materials and their emerging applications in bioimaging, biosensing, drug delivery, tissue engineering, antimicrobial, and agro-foods. Depending on their morphology (e.g., size, aspect ratio, geometry, porosity), nanomaterials can be used as formulation modifiers, moisturizers, nanofillers, additives, membranes, and films. As toxicological assessment depends on sizes and morphologies, stringent regulation is needed from the testing of efficient nanomaterials dosages. The challenges and perspectives for an industrial breakthrough of nanomaterials are related to the optimization of production and processing conditions.},
